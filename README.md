## Projects
### Human AI Interaction - Year 4
- The task for this coursework was to develop a chatbot which had to complete a transaction using the nltk library. The focus of this module was to look at the Human Computer Interaction aspects relating to chatbot conversations. I developed a Movie Booking Chatbot which used an SQL database to retrieve showings and converse with users.
- Technologies: Python, SQL, Natural Language Pipeline
- Achieved a grade of 73.55% for this piece of coursework.
### Linear Discrete Optimization - Year 4
- The task for this coursework was to develop a solution to an optimisation problem and rectify any errors in a provided reference algebraic solution. Problem description was for a car rental scenario and goal was to maximise profit.
- Technologies: LPSolve, C, Excel
- Achieved a grade of 84% for this piece of coursework.
### Mobile Device Programming - Year 3
- The task for this coursework was to develop an application for a running tracker app, which allowed a user to track their gps location on runs, walks, jogs along with the timings and other features.
- Technologies: Java, Android Studio
- Achieved a grade of 79% for this piece of coursework.
### Developing Maintable Software - Year 2
- This coursework task was about maintaining and extending a re-implementation of a classic retro
game called Breakout. There was an existing game provided which I then re-factored to make it more maintable and therefore reusable in the future, one methodology being splitting the classes into an Model View Controller pattern.
- Technologies: Java, MVC 
- Achieved a grade of 81% for this piece of coursework.
